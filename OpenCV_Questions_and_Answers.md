## 1. Image Loading and Basic Operations

### Q1: What is OpenCV and what does cv2 represent?
**Answer:** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. `cv2` is the Python module name for OpenCV, which provides Python bindings for the OpenCV library.

### Q2: What are the different flags available in cv2.imread()?
**Answer:** 
- `cv2.IMREAD_COLOR` or `1`: Loads image in color (BGR format) - default
- `cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE` or `0`: Loads image in grayscale mode
- `cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED` or `-1`: Loads image including alpha channel
```python
img_color = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg', 1)        # Color
img_gray = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg', 0)         # Grayscale
img_unchanged = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg', -1)   # With alpha channel
```

### Q3: How do you check if an image was loaded successfully?
**Answer:** Check if the image object is `None`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
if img is None:
    print("Image not loaded")
else:
    print("Image loaded successfully")
```

### Q4: What does the shape attribute of an image return?
**Answer:** The shape attribute returns a tuple containing (height, width, channels):
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg', 1)
h, w, c = img.shape
print(f"Height: {h}, Width: {w}, Channels: {c}")
```
For grayscale images, it returns only (height, width).

### Q5: How do you display an image using OpenCV?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.imshow()` followed by `cv2.waitKey()` and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
cv2.imshow('Window Title', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)  # Wait until key press
cv2.destroyAllWindows()  # Close all windows
```

### Q6: What is the purpose of cv2.waitKey()?
**Answer:** `cv2.waitKey()` waits for a keyboard input:
- `cv2.waitKey(0)`: Waits indefinitely until a key is pressed
- `cv2.waitKey(2000)`: Waits for 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
- Returns -1 if no key is pressed within the specified time

### Q7: How do you save an image using OpenCV?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.imwrite()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('input.jpeg')
cv2.imwrite('output.jpeg', img)
```

### Q8: How do you convert a color image to grayscale?
**Answer:** Two methods:
1. Load directly as grayscale: `img = cv2.imread('image.jpg', 0)`
2. Convert using cvtColor: `gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`

### Q9: Why does OpenCV use BGR instead of RGB?
**Answer:** OpenCV uses BGR (Blue-Green-Red) format instead of RGB for historical reasons. When OpenCV was first developed, BGR was the standard format used by many imaging libraries and hardware. This format is still maintained for backward compatibility.

### Q10: What happens if you try to load a non-existent image file?
**Answer:** `cv2.imread()` returns `None` without throwing an error. Always check if the returned image is None before processing.

---

## 2. Image Transformations

### Q11: How do you resize an image in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.resize()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
resized = cv2.resize(img, (500, 500))  # (width, height)
```

### Q12: What is the difference between resizing with absolute values vs. scaling factors?
**Answer:** 
- Absolute values: `cv2.resize(img, (500, 500))` - exact dimensions
- Scaling factors: `cv2.resize(img, None, fx=0.5, fy=0.5)` - 50% of original size

### Q13: How do you rotate an image in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Use rotation matrix with `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D()` and `cv2.warpAffine()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
center = (img.shape[1]//2, img.shape[0]//2)
matrix = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(center, 90, 1)  # center, angle, scale
rotated = cv2.warpAffine(img, matrix, (img.shape[1], img.shape[0]))
```

### Q14: What do the parameters in cv2.getRotationMatrix2D() represent?
**Answer:** 
- First parameter: Center point of rotation (x, y)
- Second parameter: Rotation angle in degrees (positive = counter-clockwise)
- Third parameter: Scaling factor (1.0 = no scaling, 0.5 = half size)

### Q15: How do you flip an image in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.flip()`:
```python
flipped_vertical = cv2.flip(img, 0)    # Flip vertically
flipped_horizontal = cv2.flip(img, 1)  # Flip horizontally
flipped_both = cv2.flip(img, -1)       # Flip both ways
```

### Q16: What are the flip codes in cv2.flip()?
**Answer:** 
- `0`: Vertical flip (flip top to bottom)
- `1`: Horizontal flip (flip left to right)
- `-1`: Both flips (horizontal + vertical)

### Q17: How do you crop an image in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Use array slicing:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
cropped = img[start_y:end_y, start_x:end_x]  # [y_range, x_range]
# Example: cropped = img[0:500, 100:500]
```

### Q18: Why is the order [y, x] in image cropping?
**Answer:** Images are stored as numpy arrays where the first dimension is height (rows/y-axis) and the second dimension is width (columns/x-axis). This follows the matrix convention [rows, columns].

### Q19: What is the difference between cv2.warpAffine() and cv2.warpPerspective()?
**Answer:** 
- `cv2.warpAffine()`: Uses 2x3 transformation matrix, preserves parallel lines
- `cv2.warpPerspective()`: Uses 3x3 transformation matrix, can change perspective (parallel lines may converge)

### Q20: How do you maintain aspect ratio while resizing?
**Answer:** Calculate the scaling factor based on one dimension:
```python
height, width = img.shape[:2]
aspect_ratio = width / height
new_width = 500
new_height = int(new_width / aspect_ratio)
resized = cv2.resize(img, (new_width, new_height))
```

## 3. Drawing Operations

### Q21: How do you draw a line on an image?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.line()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
pt1 = (100, 100)  # Starting point (x, y)
pt2 = (1000, 1000)  # Ending point (x, y)
color = (255, 0, 0)  # BGR color
thickness = 2
cv2.line(img, pt1, pt2, color, thickness)
```

### Q22: What color format does OpenCV use for drawing operations?
**Answer:** OpenCV uses BGR (Blue, Green, Red) format:
- (255, 0, 0) = Blue
- (0, 255, 0) = Green
- (0, 0, 255) = Red
- (255, 255, 255) = White
- (0, 0, 0) = Black

### Q23: How do you draw a rectangle on an image?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.rectangle()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
pt1 = (100, 100)    # Top-left corner
pt2 = (1000, 1000)  # Bottom-right corner
color = (255, 0, 0) # BGR color
thickness = -1      # -1 fills the rectangle
cv2.rectangle(img, pt1, pt2, color, thickness)
```

### Q24: What does thickness = -1 mean in drawing functions?
**Answer:** `thickness = -1` fills the shape completely instead of just drawing the outline. For positive values, it represents the thickness of the outline in pixels.

### Q25: How do you draw a circle on an image?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.circle()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
center = (500, 500)  # Center point (x, y)
radius = 300
color = (255, 0, 0)  # BGR color
thickness = 20       # Outline thickness
cv2.circle(img, center, radius, color, thickness)
```

### Q26: How do you add text to an image?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.putText()`:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
text = "Hello World"
font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX
size = 10
position = (100, 800)  # Bottom-left corner of text
color = (255, 0, 0)    # BGR color
thickness = 4
cv2.putText(img, text, position, font, size, color, thickness)
```

### Q27: What are the different font types available in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Common fonts include:
- `cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX`
- `cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_PLAIN`
- `cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_DUPLEX`
- `cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_COMPLEX`
- `cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_TRIPLEX`
- `cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SCRIPT_SIMPLEX`

### Q28: What coordinate system does OpenCV use?
**Answer:** OpenCV uses a coordinate system where:
- Origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner
- X-axis increases from left to right
- Y-axis increases from top to bottom

### Q29: How do you draw multiple shapes on the same image?
**Answer:** Simply call multiple drawing functions on the same image object:
```python
img = cv2.imread('image1.jpeg')
cv2.line(img, (0, 0), (100, 100), (255, 0, 0), 2)
cv2.circle(img, (200, 200), 50, (0, 255, 0), -1)
cv2.rectangle(img, (300, 300), (400, 400), (0, 0, 255), 3)
```

### Q30: How do you draw a filled vs. outlined shape?
**Answer:** 
- Outlined: Use positive thickness value
- Filled: Use `thickness = -1`
```python
cv2.circle(img, center, radius, color, 3)   # Outlined circle
cv2.circle(img, center, radius, color, -1)  # Filled circle
```

## 4. Video Processing

### Q31: What is a video in terms of image processing?
**Answer:** A video is a sequence of images (frames) displayed rapidly one after another (typically 30-60 FPS) to create the perception of continuous motion. Each frame is essentially a single image.

### Q32: How do you capture video from a webcam?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.VideoCapture()`:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # 0 for default webcam
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret:
        cv2.imshow('Frame', frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    else:
        break
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Q33: What do the camera indices represent in VideoCapture?
**Answer:** 
- `0`: First camera (default/built-in webcam)
- `1`: Second camera (external USB camera)
- `2`: Third camera device
- And so on...

### Q34: What does cap.read() return?
**Answer:** `cap.read()` returns a tuple:
- `ret`: Boolean indicating if frame was successfully captured
- `frame`: The actual image frame as a numpy array
```python
ret, frame = cap.read()
if ret:  # Check if frame was captured successfully
    # Process the frame
```

### Q35: Why do we use `cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q')`?
**Answer:** 
- `cv2.waitKey(1)`: Waits 1 millisecond for a key press
- `& 0xFF`: Masks the result to get only the lower 8 bits (handles platform differences)
- `ord('q')`: Gets the ASCII value of 'q' (113)
- This combination checks if 'q' was pressed to exit the loop

### Q36: How do you record video to a file?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.VideoWriter()`:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
frame_width = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH))
frame_height = int(cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT))
codec = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
recorder = cv2.VideoWriter('output.mp4', codec, 30, (frame_width, frame_height))

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if ret:
        recorder.write(frame)
        cv2.imshow('Recording', frame)
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    else:
        break

cap.release()
recorder.release()  # Important: release the writer
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Q37: What are the parameters of cv2.VideoWriter()?
**Answer:** 
- `filename`: Output video file name
- `fourcc`: Video codec (e.g., cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v'))
- `fps`: Frames per second
- `frameSize`: Frame dimensions as (width, height) tuple

### Q38: What is a codec in video processing?
**Answer:** A codec (compressor-decompressor) is a method of compressing and decompressing video data. Common codecs include:
- `'mp4v'`: MP4 video
- `'XVID'`: XVID codec
- `'MJPG'`: Motion JPEG

### Q39: How do you read a video file instead of webcam?
**Answer:** Pass the file path instead of camera index:
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('input_video.mp4')
```

### Q40: What's the difference between cap.release() and cv2.destroyAllWindows()?
**Answer:** 
- `cap.release()`: Frees the video capture object (camera/video file)
- `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`: Closes all OpenCV display windows and frees memory
Both are necessary for proper cleanup.

## 5. Image Filtering

### Q41: What is Gaussian blur and when is it used?
**Answer:** Gaussian blur is a linear filter that smooths images by averaging pixels with their neighbors using the Gaussian function. It's used for:
- Noise reduction
- Creating depth of field effects (portrait mode)
- Preprocessing for edge detection
```python
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (119, 119), 3)
```

### Q42: What are the parameters of cv2.GaussianBlur()?
**Answer:** 
- `image`: Input image
- `ksize`: Kernel size (width, height) - must be odd numbers
- `sigmaX`: Gaussian kernel standard deviation in X direction
- `sigmaY`: (optional) Standard deviation in Y direction
```python
cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (kernel_x, kernel_y), sigma)
```

### Q43: What is the difference between Gaussian blur and Median blur?
**Answer:** 
- **Gaussian blur**: Averages pixels using Gaussian weights, good for general smoothing
- **Median blur**: Replaces each pixel with the median of neighboring pixels, excellent for removing salt-and-pepper noise while preserving edges
```python
gaussian_blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (21, 21), 3)
median_blur = cv2.medianBlur(img, 21)
```

### Q44: When would you use Median blur over Gaussian blur?
**Answer:** Use median blur when:
- Dealing with salt-and-pepper noise (random black/white dots)
- Processing old scanned documents
- Need to preserve edges while removing noise
- Working with security camera footage with artifacts

### Q45: How do you sharpen an image in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Use a sharpening kernel with `cv2.filter2D()`:
```python
import numpy as np
kernel = np.array([[ 0, -1,  0],
                   [-1,  10, -1],
                   [ 0, -1,  0]])
sharpened = cv2.filter2D(img, -1, kernel)
```

### Q46: What does the sharpening kernel do?
**Answer:** The sharpening kernel enhances edges by:
- The center value (10) amplifies the current pixel
- The surrounding negative values (-1) subtract neighbor influences
- This increases contrast at edges, making them appear sharper

### Q47: What does cv2.filter2D() do?
**Answer:** `cv2.filter2D()` applies a custom kernel (filter) to an image through convolution:
- First parameter: Input image
- Second parameter: Desired depth of output image (-1 means same as input)
- Third parameter: Kernel/filter to apply

### Q48: How do kernel sizes affect blur operations?
**Answer:** 
- Larger kernel size = more blur effect
- Smaller kernel size = less blur effect
- Kernel sizes must be odd numbers (3x3, 5x5, 21x21, etc.)
- Processing time increases with kernel size

### Q49: What is the difference between linear and non-linear filters?
**Answer:** 
- **Linear filters**: Output is a linear combination of input pixels (e.g., Gaussian blur)
- **Non-linear filters**: Use non-linear operations like sorting (e.g., median blur)

### Q50: How do you create a motion blur effect?
**Answer:** Use a directional kernel:
```python
import numpy as np
# Horizontal motion blur
kernel = np.zeros((15, 15))
kernel[7, :] = np.ones(15) / 15  # Middle row filled with 1/15
motion_blur = cv2.filter2D(img, -1, kernel)
```

## 6. Thresholding and Edge Detection

### Q51: What is binary thresholding?
**Answer:** Binary thresholding converts a grayscale image to binary (black and white) by setting pixels above a threshold to maximum value (255) and pixels below to 0. Commonly used in OCR and document scanning.
```python
ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(img, 70, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
```

### Q52: What are the parameters of cv2.threshold()?
**Answer:** 
- `src`: Source grayscale image
- `thresh`: Threshold value
- `maxval`: Maximum value assigned to pixels above threshold
- `type`: Thresholding type (e.g., cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
Returns: threshold value and thresholded image

### Q53: What are the different types of thresholding?
**Answer:** 
- `cv2.THRESH_BINARY`: Above threshold = maxval, below = 0
- `cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV`: Above threshold = 0, below = maxval
- `cv2.THRESH_TRUNC`: Above threshold = threshold, below = unchanged
- `cv2.THRESH_TOZERO`: Above threshold = unchanged, below = 0
- `cv2.THRESH_TOZERO_INV`: Above threshold = 0, below = unchanged

### Q54: What is Canny edge detection?
**Answer:** Canny edge detection is an algorithm that detects edges by finding areas of rapid intensity change. It's widely used for:
- Object boundary detection
- Feature extraction
- Lane detection in autonomous vehicles
```python
edges = cv2.Canny(img, threshold1, threshold2)
```

### Q55: What do the thresholds in Canny edge detection represent?
**Answer:** 
- `threshold1` (low): Below this = not an edge (noise)
- `threshold2` (high): Above this = strong edge
- Between thresholds: Weak edge, kept only if connected to strong edge
```python
edges = cv2.Canny(img, 30, 60)  # Low=30, High=60
```

### Q56: What are bitwise operations in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Bitwise operations perform pixel-wise logical operations:
- `cv2.bitwise_and()`: Keeps pixels bright in both images (intersection)
- `cv2.bitwise_or()`: Combines bright pixels from both images (union)  
- `cv2.bitwise_xor()`: Keeps only different pixels
- `cv2.bitwise_not()`: Inverts image (like negative)

### Q57: When would you use bitwise operations?
**Answer:** Bitwise operations are useful for:
- Image masking and region of interest selection
- Combining multiple images
- Creating artistic effects
- Background subtraction
- Logo/watermark placement

### Q58: How do you create an image mask?
**Answer:** Create a binary mask and use bitwise operations:
```python
# Create mask (white circle on black background)
mask = np.zeros(img.shape[:2], np.uint8)
cv2.circle(mask, (center_x, center_y), radius, 255, -1)
# Apply mask
result = cv2.bitwise_and(img, img, mask=mask)
```

### Q59: What's the difference between cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE and cv2.cvtColor()?
**Answer:** 
- `cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE`: Loads image directly as grayscale (1 channel)
- `cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`: Converts existing color image to grayscale
Both produce the same result, but loading as grayscale is more memory efficient.

### Q60: Why do we convert to grayscale before thresholding?
**Answer:** Thresholding works on single-channel images. Grayscale conversion:
- Reduces complexity from 3 channels to 1
- Simplifies threshold decision-making
- Reduces processing time and memory usage
- Most edge and shape information is preserved

## 7. Contour Detection

### Q61: What are contours in OpenCV?
**Answer:** Contours are curves that join continuous points of the same color or intensity along object boundaries. They represent the shape/outline of objects in an image and are used for:
- Shape detection and analysis
- Object recognition
- Area and perimeter calculation

### Q62: What preprocessing is required before finding contours?
**Answer:** 
1. Convert to grayscale: `gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)`
2. Apply binary thresholding: `ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 150, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)`
3. Find contours on the binary image

### Q63: What does cv2.findContours() return?
**Answer:** `cv2.findContours()` returns:
- `contours`: List of arrays containing boundary points for each object
- `hierarchy`: Array describing the relationship between contours (parent-child)
```python
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```

### Q64: What are the different retrieval modes in cv2.findContours()?
**Answer:** 
- `cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL`: Only outermost contours
- `cv2.RETR_LIST`: All contours without hierarchy
- `cv2.RETR_CCOMP`: Two-level hierarchy (outer and holes)
- `cv2.RETR_TREE`: Complete hierarchy tree of contours

### Q65: What's the difference between CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE and CHAIN_APPROX_NONE?
**Answer:** 
- `CHAIN_APPROX_NONE`: Stores every boundary point (detailed but large)
- `CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE`: Stores only essential points (e.g., 4 corners of rectangle)
CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE is more memory efficient and usually sufficient.

### Q66: How do you draw contours on an image?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.drawContours()`:
```python
cv2.drawContours(img, contours, -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)
# Parameters: image, contours, contourIndex (-1=all), color, thickness
```

### Q67: How do you find the area of a contour?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.contourArea()`:
```python
for contour in contours:
    area = cv2.contourArea(contour)
    print(f"Contour area: {area}")
```

### Q68: How do you filter contours by area?
**Answer:** 
```python
min_area = 100
filtered_contours = []
for contour in contours:
    if cv2.contourArea(contour) > min_area:
        filtered_contours.append(contour)
```

### Q69: How do you find the perimeter of a contour?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.arcLength()`:
```python
for contour in contours:
    perimeter = cv2.arcLength(contour, True)  # True for closed contour
    print(f"Perimeter: {perimeter}")
```

### Q70: What is contour approximation and how is it used?
**Answer:** Contour approximation reduces the number of points in a contour while preserving its shape:
```python
epsilon = 0.02 * cv2.arcLength(contour, True)
approx = cv2.approxPolyDP(contour, epsilon, True)
# Useful for detecting geometric shapes (rectangles, triangles, etc.)
```

---

## 8. Advanced Topics

### Q71: How do you detect specific shapes using contours?
**Answer:** Analyze the number of vertices after contour approximation:
```python
epsilon = 0.02 * cv2.arcLength(contour, True)
approx = cv2.approxPolyDP(contour, epsilon, True)
vertices = len(approx)

if vertices == 3:
    shape = "Triangle"
elif vertices == 4:
    shape = "Rectangle/Square"
elif vertices > 4:
    shape = "Circle/Ellipse"
```

### Q72: How do you find the center of a contour?
**Answer:** Use moments:
```python
M = cv2.moments(contour)
if M["m00"] != 0:
    cx = int(M["m10"] / M["m00"])  # x-coordinate of center
    cy = int(M["m01"] / M["m00"])  # y-coordinate of center
```

### Q73: How do you crop an object using its contour?
**Answer:** 
```python
x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)
cropped = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
```

### Q74: What is morphological operations and when to use them?
**Answer:** Morphological operations modify shapes in binary images:
- `cv2.morphologyEx(img, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)`: Remove noise
- `cv2.morphologyEx(img, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)`: Fill gaps
- `cv2.morphologyEx(img, cv2.MORPH_GRADIENT, kernel)`: Find edges
Used for noise removal and shape refinement.

### Q75: How do you create a Region of Interest (ROI)?
**Answer:** 
```python
# Method 1: Rectangle ROI
roi = img[y1:y2, x1:x2]

# Method 2: Mask-based ROI
mask = np.zeros(img.shape[:2], np.uint8)
cv2.rectangle(mask, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), 255, -1)
roi = cv2.bitwise_and(img, img, mask=mask)
```

### Q76: How do you handle different image formats in OpenCV?
**Answer:** OpenCV supports various formats:
```python
# Reading different formats
img_jpg = cv2.imread('image.jpg')
img_png = cv2.imread('image.png')
img_bmp = cv2.imread('image.bmp')

# Saving in different formats
cv2.imwrite('output.jpg', img)
cv2.imwrite('output.png', img)
```

### Q77: How do you work with image channels?
**Answer:** 
```python
# Split channels
b, g, r = cv2.split(img)

# Merge channels
merged = cv2.merge([b, g, r])

# Access individual channel
blue_channel = img[:, :, 0]
green_channel = img[:, :, 1]
red_channel = img[:, :, 2]
```

### Q78: How do you convert between color spaces?
**Answer:** Use `cv2.cvtColor()`:
```python
# BGR to RGB
rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

# BGR to HSV
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

# BGR to LAB
lab = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB)
```

### Q79: How do you handle video properties?
**Answer:** 
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

# Get properties
fps = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
width = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH)
height = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT)

# Set properties
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS, 30)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, 640)
cap.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, 480)
```

### Q80: What are some best practices for OpenCV programming?
**Answer:** 
1. **Always check if image loaded**: `if img is None:`
2. **Proper resource cleanup**: Use `cap.release()` and `cv2.destroyAllWindows()`
3. **Error handling**: Check return values from functions
4. **Memory efficiency**: Convert to grayscale when color isn't needed
5. **Preprocessing**: Apply filters before detection operations
6. **Parameter tuning**: Experiment with threshold values
7. **Performance**: Use appropriate data types (uint8 for images)
8. **Documentation**: Comment complex operations and parameter choices
