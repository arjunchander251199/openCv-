1>Image - 2d grid (matrix/table) of pixel values
2>Pixel -smallest unit of image
A pixel actually looks like a single tiny dot on the screen, but inside it has 3 sub-pixels:

ðŸ”´ Red
ðŸŸ¢ Green
ðŸ”µ Blue

This is called RGB (Red-Green-Blue) color model.

ðŸ‘‰ Why only 3?

Human eyes have 3 types of color receptors (cones) sensitive to red, green, and blue light.

By combining these 3 in different intensities (0â€“255 each), we can make 16.7 million colors (256 Ã— 256 Ã— 256).

For example:

(255, 0, 0) â†’ pure red

(0, 255, 0) â†’ pure green

(0, 0, 255) â†’ pure blue

(255, 255, 255) â†’ white

(0, 0, 0) â†’ black



3>width - number of pixels in a row 1920


4>height - number of pixels in a column 1080


5> color Channels -ðŸ‘‰ A color image = made of many pixels
ðŸ‘‰ Each pixel = has 3 values (3 channels) â†’ Blue, Green, Red in OpenCV

Example:

Suppose image size = 1920 Ã— 1080

Total pixels = 1920 Ã— 1080 â‰ˆ 2 million pixels

Each pixel = [B, G, R]

So , (height, width, channels)
= (1080, 1920, 3)


Visualization:

One pixel â†’ [120, 50, 200]

Blue = 120

Green = 50

Red = 200

When all pixels are combined â†’ you see the full photo.



âš« Grayscale Image

Each pixel = 1 value only â†’ intensity (brightness).

Shape â†’ (height, width) (or (height, width, 1) if channel axis is kept).
